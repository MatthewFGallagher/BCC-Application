The design looks good, though when I was looking at it, I got a bit confused. How is TimeID generated? it says autonumber, but the name 
Time ID suggest that it keeps track of the time of the session, in which multiple sessions can take place at the same time. I think it 
should be session ID, as this I feel is more unique. Also, does the Begining, Middle, and End keep track of the time the counts were 
submitted, or the count itself (or both)? Can you explain alittle bit.
